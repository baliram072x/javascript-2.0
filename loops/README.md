using loops we will be able to repeat a task again and again.

1.Q--> write a program to print the numbers frm 1 to 10



1.--> WHILE LOOP 

let i= 0;
while( condition){
    set of instructions
    incremental of decremental statement 
}
let i=1
while(i<= 10){
    console.log(i);
    i+=1;
}


what is diff bet while and if ?
--> if will only cheak the condition once dosent matter if the condition is true of false it will only cheak it once 

--> where while loop cheaks the cndition again and again till the time it becomes false
